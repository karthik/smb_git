**Git** is a powerful version control system that is widely used in software development. The features of Git that make it popular among software developers also makes it ideal for managing research workflows. In this article I describe how the power of Git could be leveraged in a scientific context to improve reproduciblity, increase transparency, and make it easy for others to build upon existing work. I also provide a handful of real-world use cases describing how Git and Git hosting services such as GitHub can enhance collaborative efforts, lower barriers to data re-use, and accelerate development of new ideas.
