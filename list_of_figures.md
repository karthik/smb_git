### Figure 1

A hypothetical Git workflow for a scientific collaboration involving three authors. Each circle represents a commit and colors denote author specific commits. Two way arrows indicate a sync (a push and pull in Git terminology). One way arrows indicate an update to one branch from another. Horizontal arrows indicate development along a particular branch.


### Figure 2

A list of contributions to a project on GitHub.

### Figure 3

Git makes it easy to track individual contributions through time ensuring appropriate attribution and accountability. This screenshot shows subset of commits (colored dots) by four authors over a period spanning November 17th, 2012 - January 26th, 2013.
